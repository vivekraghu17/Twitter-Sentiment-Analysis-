Welcome to Twitter Sentiment Analysis 

step 1 : Open the live graphing python file and run the code in the background , it has to display a line plot window
step 2 : Open the extract tweets file it asks for the hashword and 
		 run the code parallel to the plot and observe the plot which indicates negative to positive slope
Step 3 : Initially before running the above code make sure that the twitter out file is empty and then run the code and 
		 the analysis value that is positive or negative is appended to the file 

Thank you :)
